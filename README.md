Spring 2021 CSCI 262 Data Structures

Created a game of hang man where you can not win. The game would change the hidden word using maps to make it unlikely that the player
would guess the full word.
The only way you could win is if there was no words left in the dictionary.txt file that had the already guessed letters.

Starter code was provided.
